# Emacs+Cider demo

Files for an introductory presentation on Emacs+Cider.

## Vagrant

You can test out Emacs, Cider, and Clojure in a self-contained VM
using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

If you have a Vagrant installed, just run `vagrant up` to bring up the
box, and `vagrant ssh` to log in and start hacking.

## Ubuntu

The `install.sh` script is used for provisioning Vagrant but the
commands there should also work to install the relevant dependencies
on any Ubuntu 14.04 system.
